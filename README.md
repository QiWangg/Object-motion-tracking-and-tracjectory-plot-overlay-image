This protocol and accompanying Python code provide a step-by-step guide to tracking an object in a video using ImageJ and overlaying its trajectory on the video frames.

In this project, video recorded with Nikon Ti-2 Inverted Microscope, with 40X (0.75 NA) objective. Video pixel size: 3.6364 pixel/µm; frame rate 30 fps. Video saved in .nd2 form. Trajectory of micromotors were analysized by FIJI Imagej.

Analysis protocol: 
  1- Open .nd2 file. 
  2- Set thershold, make sure only object is selected.
  3- Plugins -> Tracking -> Trackmate. 
  4- Select a detector: LoG detector. 
  5- Estimated object diameter: Set as the size of micromotors (5 µm for RBC micromotors). Quality threshold: Set as slightly smaller than Estimated object diameter (4 µm for this project). 
  6- Set filter on spots: Keep default settings (Can be changed as needed). 
  7- Select a tracker: Simple LAP tracjer. Linking mas distance: same as Estimated object diameter (5 µm for this project); Gap-closing max distance: Set as slightly larger than Estimated object diameter (6 µm for this project). 
  8- Set filters on tracks: set as needed. 
  9- Click 'Tracks' to expert tracking data to .csv file. ('TRACKING DATA.csv').
  10- Run accompanying Python Code.
